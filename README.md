This Repository is to give basic understanding of Optimization for a Person who is interested in Python. And someone who is a Beginner to Python.

A Manufacturing company manufactures 2 types of Cars. ‘CarA’ & ‘CarB’.In manufacturing of cars there are some constraints (Conditions) that company needs to satisfy. And each car’s generated profit by selling is different.  Company needs to know how much of ‘CarA’ and ‘CarB’ should manufactured (So these are decision variables) in order to maximizing the profits (Objective).</br></br>*Assembly Line Capacity Constraints*
In production assembly line it is taken 0.5 Days to assemble ‘CarA’ and 0.25 Days to assemble ‘CarB’. Monthly they have 20 Days to Assembling purposes.</br></br> *Painting and Finishing Constraints*
</br></br>In finishing line it would take 0.15 days to paint a one ‘CarA’. For ‘CarB’ it requires 0.10 days. Monthly they have 10 Days to do the painting and Finishing processes.</br></br>*Demand Factor constraints*
</br></br>To cater the global demand, it is required to manufacture 10 Units minimum from both cars.</br></br>*Profit Maximizing - Objective*
</br></br>And profits by selling 1 car is respectively 12000 dollars and 15000 dollars from ‘CarA’ and ‘CarB’.In order to profit maximizing how many units need to be produced from each Car’s.
